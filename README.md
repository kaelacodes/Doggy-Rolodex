## Overview:
Doggydex App was born from the Pokedex App (a student project) which I ventured to take further by recreating the App using a different API on my own, in order to dig further into the concept of using APIs. I enjoyed recreating this project following a theme that I felt more personally inspired by. I also appreciated the oportunity to confront gaps in my understanding of how certain pieces of code really work by exploring them in a different context without explicite instruction, as well as the opportunity to learn how to debug my code in a hands on way rather than in theory when I came accross obsticals.

### Objective:
Doggydex App is a small web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that loads data from an external API and enables the viewing of dog related data points in detail on demand.

### Key Features:
* Loads data from an external source (API)
